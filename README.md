# AiHiii

## Description

AI on base of FE simulations with HIII dummy.
Code base for data generation and evaluation, machine learning trial generation
and evaluation.

The code base was generated during the doctorate studies. The title of the
dissertation is: 'Accelerated Virtual Evaluation of Restraint System Performance
for Vehicle Occupants with Varying Body Shapes'.

The required databases were published under DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14610182.
The Results of machine learning under the DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14608924.
The related Finite Element Simulation were published under the DOIs 10.5281/zenodo.13998073, 10.5281/zenodo.14000052, 10.5281/zenodo.14000145, 10.5281/zenodo.13998257, 10.5281/zenodo.14000200.
